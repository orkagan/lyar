# Lyar
NCSS 2015 Group 2's project. A web version of the classic game "Two Truths, One Lie."

## Running the server
Prerequisites:
* Python **3.4** (Tornado does not support Python 2, and we are using `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac` which was first added in 3.4.)

Simply run `run.py` and the server should start serving at `localhost:8888`.
